# Destruction Overdrive

Distruction Overdrive was a game that myself and a few other computer science senior computer science students created as our final Software design and development project in 2007.

# The Idea

We would have customizable ships that you could fly in a 3D area and do battle. Your ships could have armor, electronic shields, lasers, missles, and other rocket ship battle weapons and armor.

The project was written in C++ with bindings to [GameMaker](http://www.yoyogames.com/studio). The first version was to be in 2d space with GameMaker, and later ported to a 3d engine.

# The team

Destruction Overdrive was worked on by Charles Shuller, Josh Bavari, Corbin, and Moustapha.
